# 120 years of Olympics History

To write and understand SQL queries, first thing is to understand the dataset. 
After understanding the dataset, it becomes much simpler to write SQL Queries to retrieve any information from that data.

Here, I have tried to write SQL Queries on a real dataset. I have downloaded the 120 years of Olympics History dataset from Kaggle. 
This way instead of using cooked up data, I have used real data to write my SQL Queries. 
By understanding these queries, we can easily retrieve the information from other types of problems also.

I have to tried to give answer of the following quesions:

--1. total olympics games that have been held till 2016-- 
--2. total no of nations who participated in each olympics game-- 
--3. year in which highest and lowest no of countries participated--
--4. Sport which was played in all summer olympics--
--5. sports which were played in all summer olympics--
--6. Sports that were just played only once in the olympics-- 
--7. total no of sports played in each olympic games--
--8. oldest athletes to win a gold medal--
--9. Ratio of male and female athletes who participated in all olympic games--
--10. top 5 athletes who have won the most gold medals--
--11. top 5 athletes who have won the most medals (gold/silver/bronze)--
--12. top 5 most successful countries in olympics (Success is defined by no of medals won)--
--13. total gold, silver and bronze medals won by each country--
--14. total gold, silver and bronze medals won by each country corresponding to each olympic games--
--15. country that won the most gold, most silver and most bronze medals in each olympic games--
