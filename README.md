## 120 years of Olympics History


To write and understand SQL queries, first thing is to understand the dataset. 
After understanding the dataset, it becomes much simpler to write SQL Queries to retrieve any information from that data.

Here, I have tried to write SQL Queries on a real dataset. I have downloaded the 120 years of Olympics History dataset from Kaggle. 
This way instead of using cooked up data, I have used real data to write my SQL Queries. 
By understanding these queries, we can easily retrieve the information from other types of problems also.
